# step-by-step

1. clone the repo
2. on terminal, run `docker-compose up -d`
3. access the container with 'localhost/8080' on your browser
4. for scalling the container we can use `docker-compose --scalling <service-name>:<number of scale>``

**Personal Note: for further improvements mind to use Kubernetes deployment replicas, also using HPA autoscaller.**
